This project focused on the design, modeling, and simulation of a **custom four-wheel-drive (4WD) differential robot**. The robot was fully modeled in **Fusion360** and exported for integration with **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**, enabling physics-based simulation and testing in realistic environments.

The robot was developed with modularity in mind, supporting potential extensions for navigation, AI, and reinforcement learning experiments. The 4WD differential drive system was chosen for its balance between maneuverability and stability, making it suitable for research and testing of autonomous robotics algorithms.

Highlights: <br/><br/>
- **Custom Robot Design**: Built a fully parametric 4WD differential-drive robot model in Fusion360. <br/>
- **Simulation in Isaac Sim**: Imported the robot into NVIDIA Isaac Sim to test kinematics, dynamics, and control strategies. <br/>
- **Expandability**: Planning on to design the platform for integration with AI, computer vision, and reinforcement learning projects. <br/>
