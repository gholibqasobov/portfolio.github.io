This research project explored the development, modeling, and control of a Ball-and-Beam system using Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers. The system serves as a benchmark in control engineering education and research, providing insights into nonlinear dynamics and feedback control principles. The objective was to stabilize the position of a steel ball on a beam by adjusting the beam angle through a servo motor, overcoming inherent instability with feedback control mechanisms.

Highlights:

    Mathematical Modeling: Developed a model using physical laws and linear approximations.
    Transfer Function Derivation: Facilitated effective PID controller design.
    Simulations: Conducted to determine initial PID coefficients and predict system behavior.
    Hardware Implementation: Built a prototype using an ESP32 microcontroller, servo motor, ultrasonic sensors, and a rail system.
    Experimental Insights: Real-world tests revealed bounded oscillations due to unmodeled dynamics, sensor noise, and actuator overshoot, contrasting with smoother theoretical predictions.
