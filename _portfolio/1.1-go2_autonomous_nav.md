This project demonstrates the autonomous navigation capabilities of the robot dog. Initially, the robot dog is manually teleoperated around the building to create a detailed map of the environment. After mapping, several goal points can be saved, and the robot dog will autonomously navigate to each of them. The goal points update automatically as the robot dog approaches them. For navigation, the robot dog utilizes a LiDAR sensor and an IMU.
