This project showcases an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe-playing robot that competes against human players using advanced robotics and computer vision techniques. Implemented with ROS2 Humble, the system leverages YOLOv8 for accurate classification of the game board, X-figure, and O-figure, while using the Minimax algorithm for optimal gameplay strategy. The physical components, including the board, figures, and stand, were designed in Fusion 360 and 3D-printed for a professional finish.

Highlights:
    - Computer Vision: Trained a YOLOv8 model to classify game elements with precision.
    - ROS2 Communication: Seamless integration of camera and robot nodes via ROS2 topics.
    - Game Intelligence: Implemented the Minimax algorithm for strategic gameplay.
    - 3D Design and Printing: Designed and prototyped physical components in Fusion 360.
    - Public Engagement: Presented at ITFest 2024 in Kazakhstan, receiving wide acclaim for its engaging and interactive experience.
