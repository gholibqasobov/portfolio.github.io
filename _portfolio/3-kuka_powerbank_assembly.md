This collaborative project, developed alongside Dosymzhan Birzhanuly and Akniyazov Esimzhan, focused on designing and implementing a versatile end-effector to streamline the assembly of power banks. The end-effector features two tool-center-points (TCP): a vacuum gripper for precise object handling and a screwdriver for assembly tasks. Designed in Fusion360 and 3D-printed, the custom end-effector was integrated with a KUKA manipulator. The manipulator program was developed in RoboDK and thoroughly tested in simulation before real-world application.

Highlights: <br/> <br/>
    - Custom End-Effector Design: Created a dual-function tool with vacuum gripper and screwdriver capabilities. <br/>
    - Simulation and Testing: Verified manipulator operations in RoboDK simulations to ensure reliability. <br/>
    - Practical Success: Successfully automated the assembly of a power bank in practice. <br/>
    - Collaborative Development: Worked in a team to design, test, and implement the solution. <br/>
