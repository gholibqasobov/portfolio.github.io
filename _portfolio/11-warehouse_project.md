This research project, published in the **Herald of Kazakh-British Technical University (2024)**, presents the design and implementation of a **mobile robot platform for smart warehouse management systems**. The work was conducted collaboratively with co-authors **T. I. Samigulin, K. A. Mlikova, R. R. Tolengutov, D. A. Butakova, A. Z. Nakhimov, and G. L. Qasobov**.

The platform was based on a **modified TurtleBot3**, upgraded from the Burger to the Waffle configuration, and equipped with a **robotic arm mounted on a custom platform**. The system was tasked with navigating through warehouse cells, transporting payloads, and placing them accurately in goal cells.

My main contribution focused on the **navigation and path-planning algorithms**. I developed a BFS-based planner and integrated it with **ROS2 Navigation Stack (Nav2)** to enable robust path planning, obstacle avoidance, and autonomous navigation. The workflow included initial testing in **Gazebo simulation**, followed by successful trials on the **real robot platform**.

Highlights: <br/><br/>
- **Published Research**: Peer-reviewed article in *Herald of Kazakh-British Technical University*, 2024. <br/>
- **Custom Robot Platform**: Adapted TurtleBot3 Burger into Waffle with robotic arm and load-carrying platform. <br/>
- **Navigation Algorithm**: Developed a BFS-based planner integrated with ROS2 for reliable navigation and obstacle avoidance. <br/>
- **Simulation & Real-World Testing**: Validated algorithms in Gazebo before conducting experiments on the physical robot. <br/>
- **Smart Warehouse Application**: Demonstrated efficient inventory transportation and placement in dynamic environments. <br/>
