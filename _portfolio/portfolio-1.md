This project demonstrates the development of a voice-controlled system for the Unitree Go2 quadruped robot, with commands implemented in the Kazakh language. Leveraging the ROS2 Humble platform and an offline large language model (LLM), the system enables seamless and efficient communication without relying on external servers, ensuring low latency and enhanced privacy.
