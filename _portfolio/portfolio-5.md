This project involved implementing an intelligent pick-and-place system using the DoBot robotic arm. The system utilized AprilTag technology to detect objects with attached tags and precisely position them on a moving conveyor belt. Key techniques included frame transformation to determine object positions relative to the DoBot's end-effector frame and camera calibration to ensure accurate detection and placement.
