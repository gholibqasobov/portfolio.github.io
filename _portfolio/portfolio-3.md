This project showcases teleoperation of the Unitree Go2 quadruped robot using keyboard input, built on the ROS2 Humble platform. The system allows precise control of the robot and seamless access to its front camera feed for enhanced situational awareness. The official unitree_sdk2_python repository was forked and updated to implement advanced features. Wireless control was innovatively achieved using OneMesh technology from Wi-Fi routers, providing stable and extended range connectivity.
