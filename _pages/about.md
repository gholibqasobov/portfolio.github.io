🎓 I am a fourth-year student at Kazakh-British Technical University (KBTU), specializing in Automation and Robotics.


🤖 My academic interests focus on industrial manipulators and autonomous mobile robots, particularly their applications in automation and intelligent systems, with a strong emphasis on artificial intelligence and reinforcement learning.


🚀 Currently, I’m involved in ongoing research: “Development of an Automated Maintenance Inspection System in Multi-Floor Residential and Industrial Complexes Using a Mobile-Legged Robot Navigating Through Elevators.”

🟩 Additionally, I am expanding my expertise in reinforcement learning using NVIDIA frameworks and actively working on the development of a custom mobile robotic platform.
